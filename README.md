## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Instagram:
- Smooth transitions.
- Ability to paste images in the Instagram Stories (an exclusive feature).

### Snapchat:
- Easy UI and fast camera connectivity
- The ability to actually see what the camera sees is a plus point for Snapchat on iOS. While on Android, it looks at what the camera records and the shows you the camera feed.

### iMessage:
- A perfect and effortless way to communicate with other Apple users.
- Seamless connectivity between Apple devices. iMessage is everywhere; iPhones, iPads, Macs, iWatch, everything.
- Memoji support allows you to express yourself in an animated way.

### Safari:
- Single threaded browser, although slow, but ensures user privacy.
- Never fails to load content as compared to chrome which has content loading issues (sometimes, due to multithreading).

## App Idea

### I want to create an App that has the features of Instagram and SnapChat combined. With option to have streaks, posts, reels, and social networking. For example, we can make an app which can do streaks with Close Friends on Insta. That way we can increase customer retention on a daily basis. Moreover, this app includes the feature to post your viewpoints on some topic in a reel way with templates.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
